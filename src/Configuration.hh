/**
 * \brief Application configuration.
 *
 * This class loads configuration in JSON file. It will also load the plugins
 * specified in the configuration. The plugins will be loaded asynchronously
 * to reduce startup time. After it finished loading, the Finish() signal
 * will be emitted. Since the configuration is loaded asynchronously in
 * a different thread, the Finish() signal is emitted by that thread and should
 * be connect()'ed using Qt::QueuedConnection. You can call GetResult() to
 * check if the configuration is loaded successfully.
 *
 * When the browser starts, it construct a Configuration object and Load()'s it
 * before initialing the Qt web engine. This allows the Qt web engine can be
 * initialized in parallel with the configurations. If the configuration takes
 * some time to finish loading, the browser can still be started. This design
 * can ensure that the browser can be started quickly.
