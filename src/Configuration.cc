 *
 * It is OK to call member functions (e.g. DefaultZoom()) in this class to
 * get the configuration values even before the configuration file is finished
 * loading. These member functions will just block until the corresponding
 * configuration value is loaded. They will not wait until the whole file
 * has been finished loaded (i.e. after Finish() is emitted). Instead they
 * just block until the configuration value of interest has been loaded.
 * Therefore, this function should load the configuration values in the
 * same order as they are needed to ensure maximum performance.
